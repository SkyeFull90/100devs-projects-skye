// Variables
//You are getting ready to face Brock for the Boulder Badge.
// You want three Pokémon on your team that each have evolved at least once.
// You have bulbasaur which is at level 5 and evolves at level 16,
// caterpie which is at level 1 and evolves at level 7, and weedle which is at level 1 and evolves at level 7.
// Create three variables to store the number of rare candies each of your Pokémon would need to evolve
// (rare candies increase your level by one).
// Finally, create a fourth variable named totalCandies that sums all the rare candies you would need.

//Conditionals And Functions
//You have a charmander in your party.
// Charmander can only battle if the temperature is above 0 degrees celcius.
// Create one function
// that converts a Fahrenheit value to Celcius and another function
// that tells you whether charmander can battle

// Print to the console "Pikachu I choose you"
